Availablity:
It can be achieved by replicating data across different machine. It means data will be available on multiple machine
Every request resceives a (non-error) response - without guarantee that it contains the most recent write. OR
A each non failover node must execute queries
Availablity means the ability to access the cluster even if a node in the cluster goes down.


Consistency:
It is achieved by updating several nodes
Every read received the most recent write or an error
Consistency meaNS that the data is same accross the cluster, so you can read or write to/from any node and get the same data


Partition Tolerance:

Even if the connection among nodes are down then other 2 consistency and availablilty promises must be kept 
The system continues to operate despite an arbitarary number of meassages being dropped(or delayed) by the network between nodes.

Partition Tolerance means that the cluster continues to function even if there is a partition (communication break) between two nodes(both nodes are up, but can't communicate)
