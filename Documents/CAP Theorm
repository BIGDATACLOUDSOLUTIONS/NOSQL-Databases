Availablity:
It can be achieved by replicating data across different machine. It means data will be available on multiple machine. 
Replication of data to all other node may or may not happen immediately if any changes are made on any node.
Every request resceives a (non-error) response - without guarantee that it contains the most recent write. OR
A each non failover node must execute queries
Availablity means the ability to access the cluster even if a node in the cluster goes down. The cluster as a whole should respond always.


Consistency:
It is achieved by updating several nodes. 
As soon as data is written/updated on any node, while reading the same data from other node should always give latest update of data.
Every read received the most recent write or an error.
Consistency means that the data is same accross the cluster, so you can read or write to/from any node and get the same data


Partition Tolerance:

Even if the connection among nodes are down then other 2 consistency and availablilty promises must be kept 
The system continues to operate despite an arbitarary number of messages being dropped(or delayed) by the network between nodes.

Partition Tolerance means that the cluster continues to function even if there is a partition (communication break) 
between two nodes(both nodes are up, but can't communicate). All individual nodes are running and up and serve the cluster.
